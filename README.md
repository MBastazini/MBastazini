## Hello
So a friend of mine talk about my profile (not good things btw) so i'm just gonna do what comes to mind.
I'm programming in React, with TS cause i love typing, and Node (that's actually a lie).
I do like working with servers but i don't get many oppotunities to do so, and when i get my school blocks the RDP connection (thanks).

If you look very closley there is just pure text here and no emojis, you wanna know why? cause i don't wanna co over the internet looking for them.
And English isin't my native language, so probably there is like an error in line 236 (this is an irony to when vscode says there is an error in a unexisting line).

Wow! you really read all of that (or not, idk), well, thanks.
